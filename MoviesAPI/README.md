# WEB API

## Controller and Action
01. The fundamental idea of having a web api is that we will have clients that will make HTTP requests to our web api. <br/>
02. An action is a method of a controller that is executed in response to an HTTP request made to our web api <br/>
03. A controller is a class that groups a set of actions. <br/>

## Routing Rules
01. The routing rules are what allow us to map a URL with an action.  <br/>
02. The Route attribute allows us to indicate the base of the endpoint of the controller actions. <br/>
